# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project taught me how fetch data from 3rd party API and display on browsers page.

## Usage

When a user searchs some city, weather dashboard will display current and future forecasts for that city and that city name will be added to the search history. When user clicks on a city in the search history, current and future conditions for that city will be desplayed.

Go to [Weather Dashboard](https://armanbarseghyan83.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

![The weather app includes a search option, a list of cities, and a five-day forecast and current weather conditions for Atlanta.](./assets/images/screenshot.png)
